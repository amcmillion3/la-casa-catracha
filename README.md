# La Casa Catracha
## Description
### What is La Casa Catracha?
La Casa Catracha is a restaurant in Tampa, FL serving authentic Honduran food.

### Why did I build this project?
My friend's mother runs this restaurant in Tampa. They did not have a website so I offered to build one for free because I wanted the experience. 

### My Learning Experience
When approaching this project I laid out a basic sketch of what components I would use and saw the project would be pretty straight forward. There were several new things I worked on with this project. I brought in several third party libraries to handle things such as the image carousel and the small revealing animations on the menu. I gained valuable experience on how to install and use third party libraries and read through their respective documentation in order to use them effectively.
